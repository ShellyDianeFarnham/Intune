# Intune
Fashionable wearable devices in the form of a neckband and a wristband provide team biometrics and presence information to increase team awareness, social bonding, and responsiveness in hostile environments.

This project was created as a part of the NASA Space Apps challenge, in the Rock-IT Fashion and Design category.
