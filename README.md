# Intune
Fashionable wearable devices in the form of a neckband and a wristband provide team biometrics and presence information to increase team awareness, social bonding, and responsiveness in hostile environments.

This project was created as a part of the NASA Space Apps challenge, in the Rock-IT Fashion and Design category.

For this project we played with using an Intel Edison as the central device on each mote collecting sensor information, sharing information to other team members via bluetooth, and displaying information using the wearable devices.   We got as far as figuring out we could use the Intel Edison to drive the Neopixel lighting display with a master/slave connection to an Arduino, so for our hackathon presentation we focused on showing what the experience would be like on the wearable devices with an animation driven by the Arduino.
